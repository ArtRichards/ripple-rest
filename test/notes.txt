Same Currency Transfer (Hot wallet)

S and D both trust GW for 10 each 
 
GW issues S 5 dollars GW issues D 5 Dollars

S sends D $2. S now has $3
and GW is still -$10 out of possible 20
D now has $7.

Or S trusts GW for (trust.limit). Has used up trust.balance.
S sends D +0.1 RKP

(Use RKP)

========================================
Same Currency Issuance (Bank Wallet)

/v1/accounts/<sourceaddress>/payments/paths/<destinationaddress>/<amount>+<currency>+<issuer>

S is cold wallet OF the gateway!
G - Hot wallet of a gateway
D - customer of G

So G trust S for 10 RKP
D trusts G for 10 RKP (even though G doesnt currently have any RKP)

We have S issue G $5
and G issue D $5.


S is rook2pawn-gw issues RKP
S sends G 10
G sends D 5
Test that S sends D 2
and becuase of this 

S starts -10 and ends at -12
G starts at +5 and ends at +5
D starts at +5 and ends at +7

========================================

Same Currency Rippling
